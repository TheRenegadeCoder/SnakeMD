Version History
===============

.. note::
    All versions of documentation are left in the condition
    in which they were generated. At times, the navigation may
    look different than expected.

In an effort to keep history of all the documentation
for SnakeMD, we've included all old versions below
as follows:

.. note::

    The gap between v0.x and v2.x is not a mistake. Initial
    development of SnakeMD used v1.x versions, which contaminated
    the PyPI repository. To avoid failed releases due to
    version clashes, all v1.x versions have been deleted,
    and the project has jumped straight to v2.x. Consider
    v2.x to be the official release of the module. Anything
    prior to v2.x is considered a pre-release.
